# Pre-Internet: Key Figures and Concepts

Before the internet as we know it, several foundational ideas and projects laid the groundwork for networked communication. This era was marked by pioneering concepts and influential figures whose work set the stage for the digital age.

## JC Licklider
J.C.R. Licklider was a visionary psychologist and computer scientist who imagined a future where computers could facilitate global communication. He coined the term "Intergalactic Computer Network" and believed in the power of connected computing long before the internet existed. His ideas shaped ARPAâ€™s research agenda, ultimately leading to ARPANET.

## Nuclear Weapons and Cold War Influence
The Cold War drove the need for resilient communication systems that could withstand nuclear attacks. This urgency led the U.S. Department of Defense to invest in research on packet switching and decentralized networks. These early efforts were instrumental in the development of a communication system that would later evolve into the internet.

## ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency)
Founded in 1958, ARPA, later renamed DARPA, was a U.S. government agency focused on preventing technological surprises by funding advanced research. ARPA's projects, particularly ARPANET, played a pivotal role in developing early network protocols, which became the backbone of the internet.
