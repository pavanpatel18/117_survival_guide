                <p>Web 2.0, emerging in the early 2000s, marked a major shift from static, read-only websites (Web 1.0) to dynamic, user-generated platforms. It was defined by interactive features, social media, and collaborative tools. Web 2.0 democratized content creation, allowing users to contribute to and shape the web in ways that were previously unimaginable.</p>

                <h2>Google Search and PageRank: Revolutionizing Information Retrieval</h2>
                <p>Google, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998, transformed the search engine industry with its PageRank algorithm. Unlike previous search engines that relied mainly on keyword matching, Google’s PageRank evaluated the link structure of websites, essentially treating links as "votes" for a website’s authority and relevance.</p>
                <p>PageRank's ability to prioritize results based on the number and quality of links to a page made it far superior in delivering relevant content. This approach revolutionized how people found information on the web, solidifying Google as the dominant search engine. Over time, Google integrated other advanced search techniques, continuously improving its services and setting new standards for information retrieval in the Web 2.0 era.</p>
                <p>Google's success during this period also laid the groundwork for its broader ecosystem of web services, such as Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Maps, further fueling the collaborative, user-centered spirit of Web 2.0.</p>

                <h2>Roy Fielding and REST: The Backbone of Modern APIs</h2>
                <p>In 2000, Roy Fielding introduced REST (Representational State Transfer) in his Ph.D. dissertation, which became a foundational concept for modern web architecture. REST defined a set of principles for designing networked applications that communicate over HTTP, the same protocol used by the web.</p>
                <p>REST simplified communication between client and server by using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Its stateless, scalable, and flexible nature made it an ideal architecture for building web services and APIs. The RESTful approach enabled web applications to become more interconnected, allowing for a seamless exchange of data between different systems and services, thus fueling the rise of mashups and integration in the Web 2.0 era.</p>
                <p>REST continues to be a key architectural style for APIs used by major platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google, enabling diverse applications to interact and share data, forming the foundation of the modern, interconnected web.</p>

                <h2>Node.js and JavaScript: Expanding JavaScript to the Server</h2>
                <p>Before the rise of Web 2.0, JavaScript was primarily a client-side scripting language, enabling simple interactions on web pages. However, in 2009, Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js, a runtime environment that allowed JavaScript to run on the server side. This innovation dramatically expanded JavaScript’s role, making it a full-stack language that could handle both front-end and back-end development.</p>
                <p>Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, which makes it ideal for building real-time, data-intensive applications like chat servers, streaming services, and APIs. With the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript became the language of choice for building dynamic, fast, and scalable web applications, further fueling the Web 2.0 era’s demand for responsive and interactive user experiences.</p>
                <p>Node.js has since become a key technology in modern web development, enabling companies to create highly efficient and scalable applications such as Netflix, LinkedIn, and Uber.</p>

                <h2>Social Media and User-Generated Content: The Heart of Web 2.0</h2>
                <p>One of the defining features of Web 2.0 was the rise of social media platforms, where users could generate, share, and interact with content on a massive scale. Platforms like Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), and Twitter (2006) allowed users to contribute to the web in ways that were not possible during the Web 1.0 era, which was more passive and consumption-based.</p>
                <p>Social media empowered individuals to share their thoughts, photos, videos, and personal experiences with a global audience. This shift made the internet more democratic and participatory, as ordinary users became content creators, influencers, and collaborators. The impact of social media not only transformed how people interacted online but also revolutionized industries such as marketing, journalism, and entertainment.</p>
                <p>User-generated content, reviews, and peer-to-peer recommendations also became essential to e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Yelp, where users' opinions and feedback drove purchasing decisions.</p>

                <h2>AJAX: Enhancing Web Interactivity and User Experience</h2>
                <p>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) was a pivotal technology in Web 2.0 that allowed web pages to update asynchronously, without requiring a full-page reload. This created a more seamless and interactive user experience, similar to what one would expect from a desktop application.</p>
                <p>Introduced in the mid-2000s, AJAX became essential to applications like Google Maps and Gmail, which allowed users to interact with the interface without refreshing the entire page. This increased speed and responsiveness significantly improved usability and became a hallmark of Web 2.0.</p>
                <p>AJAX, coupled with other innovations like JavaScript frameworks (e.g., jQuery), laid the foundation for rich web applications and enhanced the overall user experience, further pushing the boundaries of what web applications could achieve.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Blogging and Wikis: Empowering Content Creation</h2>
                <p>The rise of blogging platforms such as Blogger (1999), WordPress (2003), and Tumblr (2007) allowed individuals to publish their thoughts, opinions, and creative content easily. Blogging democratized publishing, allowing anyone with an internet connection to become an author or influencer.</p>
                <p>Similarly, wikis, with Wikipedia as the most prominent example (founded in 2001), allowed users to collaboratively create and edit content. Wikipedia became one of the most visited websites in the world and a valuable resource for information, driven entirely by user contributions.</p>
                <p>These tools emphasized the shift from passive consumption to active creation, a defining characteristic of Web 2.0. The rise of blogs and wikis also reshaped industries such as journalism, education, and content marketing, allowing for more diverse voices and perspectives.</p>
