            <p>The internet’s journey began with ARPANET, an experimental network that demonstrated the feasibility of long-distance communication between computers. The development of key protocols and early applications laid the foundation for today’s global network.</p>

            <h2>ARPANET</h2>
            <p>ARPANET was the first operational packet-switching network, launched in 1969. It connected four U.S. universities, allowing researchers to share data and resources. Packet-switching technology, which divides data into smaller packets, ensured reliable communication and made ARPANET a groundbreaking achievement in networking.</p>

            <h2>Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn (TCP/IP)</h2>
            <p>Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are often called the “fathers of the internet” for their development of the TCP/IP protocols. These protocols enabled diverse networks to communicate, providing a standardized method for data transmission. TCP/IP became the internet’s foundation, allowing it to grow beyond ARPANET.</p>

            <h2>Early Programs on ARPANET</h2>
            <p>Programs like Gopher and Telnet were among the first applications on ARPANET, allowing users to retrieve documents and remotely access other computers. Gopher organized information in a hierarchical manner, while Telnet provided a way for users to connect to remote computers. These tools were essential in shaping how people interacted with early networks.</p>
