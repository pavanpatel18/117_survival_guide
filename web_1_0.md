# Web 1.0: The Static Web

The advent of the World Wide Web marked a new era for the internet, transforming it from a research network into a global platform for information sharing. This early phase, known as Web 1.0, was characterized by static content and simple interactivity.

## HTML & HTTP Protocol
Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML and HTTP, the core technologies of the web, in the late 1980s. HTML allowed for the structuring of web pages, while HTTP enabled the transfer of these pages over the internet. The first website went live in 1991, and these standards laid the groundwork for all web development that followed.

## JavaScript
In 1995, Brendan Eich created JavaScript to add interactivity to web pages. JavaScript allowed users to interact with content without needing to refresh the page, making it possible to develop more engaging and responsive websites. It quickly became a crucial tool for web developers.

## CSS
CSS, developed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos, was introduced in 1996 to separate content from design. By using CSS, developers could control the appearance of a website independently of its content, allowing for easier updates and more consistent design across pages.

## Perl & PHP
Perl and PHP were early server-side scripting languages that enabled dynamic web content. Perl, popular in the 1990s, was often used for CGI scripts, while PHP became a staple for web development due to its simplicity and integration with HTML.

## Linux
Linux, created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, became a preferred operating system for web servers due to its flexibility and security. As an open-source platform, Linux allowed developers to modify and adapt the system to their needs, making it foundational for many internet-based applications.

## Early Search Engines (e.g., AltaVista, HotBot)
As the web expanded, search engines like AltaVista and HotBot emerged to help users navigate the growing content. These early search engines indexed websites and provided users with tools to locate information based on keywords, setting the stage for the search-centric web.
