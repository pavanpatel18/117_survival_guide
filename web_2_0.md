# Web 2.0: The Dynamic and Social Web

Web 2.0 represented a shift from static websites to dynamic, user-driven platforms. This era brought new technologies and services that enabled richer interactions, social media, and collaborative tools.

## Google Search and PageRank
Google transformed the search landscape with its PageRank algorithm, introduced in 1998. By analyzing the link structure of the web, PageRank prioritized relevant results, making Google the most popular search engine and setting new standards for information retrieval.

## Roy Fielding and REST
Roy Fielding introduced the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style in his 2000 dissertation. REST enabled scalable and flexible communication between web applications, making it a cornerstone of modern web services and APIs.

## Node.js and JavaScript
Node.js, developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009, allowed JavaScript to be used on the server side, enabling real-time, event-driven applications. This advancement made JavaScript a full-stack language and further fueled the development of dynamic and responsive web applications.

## Python
Python, created by Guido van Rossum, gained popularity in Web 2.0 due to its readability and versatility. With frameworks like Django and Flask, Python became a popular choice for backend development, supporting complex web applications and data-driven projects.

## Git
Linus Torvalds developed Git in 2005 to manage version control for software development. Gitâ€™s distributed nature allowed developers to collaborate effectively on large projects, revolutionizing the way software is built and maintained.
