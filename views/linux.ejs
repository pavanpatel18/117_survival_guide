            <p>
                Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, especially in server environments, due to its security, performance, and flexibility.
            </p>
            <h2>History of Linux</h2>
            <p>
                In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, began working on his own operating system as a personal project. Initially, it was meant as a free alternative to the MINIX system. As an open-source project, Linux quickly gained traction in the developer community and evolved into a robust operating system used in a wide variety of applications, from personal computers to servers and supercomputers.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Features of Linux</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Linux is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiuser Environment:</strong> Linux allows multiple users to log in and work on the system simultaneously without interfering with each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Linux has built-in security features like file permissions, user accounts, and firewall capabilities, making it more secure against threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Linux can run on a wide range of hardware architectures, from personal computers to mainframes and even embedded systems like routers.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> Linux allows developers to tailor the system to their needs by modifying the source code or installing different desktop environments and software packages.</li>
                <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Linux is known for its reliability and ability to run for long periods without needing a reboot.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Common Linux Distributions</h2>
            <p>There are many distributions (also called distros) of Linux, each with its own unique features and target audience. Some popular Linux distributions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ubuntu:</strong> One of the most user-friendly and popular distributions, Ubuntu is often recommended for beginners and desktop users.</li>
                <li><strong>Fedora:</strong> Known for its cutting-edge features and focus on open-source software, Fedora is often used by developers.</li>
                <li><strong>Debian:</strong> A stable and versatile distribution, Debian forms the base for many other Linux distributions, including Ubuntu.</li>
                <li><strong>CentOS/AlmaLinux:</strong> A free, open-source alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS is widely used in server environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Arch Linux:</strong> A lightweight, minimalist distribution aimed at more experienced users who want complete control over their system.</li>
            </ul>
