                <p>The advent of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s marked a new era for the internet, transforming it from a research network into a global platform for information sharing. This early phase, known as Web 1.0, spanned from the early 1990s to around 2004 and was characterized by static, read-only content. Websites were simple, and user interaction was limited, but the foundation for the modern web was laid during this period.</p>

                <h2>HTML & HTTP Protocol: The Backbone of Web 1.0</h2>
                <p>Tim Berners-Lee, often credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web, created HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) in 1989 while working at CERN. These technologies enabled the creation of linked, hypertext documents that could be shared across the internet, forming the core structure of the web.</p>
                <p>HTML allowed developers to structure and display content using a standardized set of tags, such as headings, paragraphs, and links. Meanwhile, HTTP facilitated the transfer of web pages between servers and clients (browsers), allowing users to navigate from one page to another by clicking links. Together, HTML and HTTP allowed for the creation of the first web pages, with the first website going live on August 6, 1991.</p>
                <p>Although the early web was rudimentary, HTML and HTTP formed the foundation for the entire World Wide Web, enabling the creation of interconnected websites and information-sharing across the globe.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript: Bringing Interactivity to the Web</h2>
                <p>In 1995, Netscape Communications, one of the early leaders in web browsers, tasked Brendan Eich with creating a scripting language that could be used to add dynamic elements to web pages. The result was JavaScript, a language that enabled client-side interactivity. Unlike HTML, which structured content, and CSS, which controlled presentation, JavaScript allowed for real-time user interactions, such as form validation, dynamic content changes, and simple animations, all without the need to refresh the page.</p>
                <p>JavaScript’s rapid rise to prominence marked a significant shift from the static nature of Web 1.0. Web developers could now build interactive elements directly into web pages, laying the groundwork for the more dynamic experiences of Web 2.0. By the late 1990s, JavaScript had become a critical tool in the development of engaging web applications, and its continued evolution has made it one of the most widely used programming languages in web development today.</p>

                <h2>CSS: Separating Content from Design</h2>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) was developed in 1996 by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos to address the growing need for better control over web page design. Prior to CSS, HTML was responsible not only for structuring content but also for controlling its appearance, leading to cluttered code and inconsistent designs across web pages.</p>
                <p>CSS allowed developers to separate a website’s content from its visual design. With CSS, developers could create a consistent design theme across multiple web pages by defining styles such as fonts, colors, and layouts in a single style sheet, which was then applied to all relevant pages. This separation of concerns made web development more efficient, scalable, and maintainable.</p>
                <p>The introduction of CSS also marked the beginning of the shift toward more visually appealing and user-friendly websites, as developers gained greater control over the presentation of their content. In combination with HTML and JavaScript, CSS became an essential part of the modern web development toolkit, allowing developers to create both static and dynamic web pages with a polished look.</p>
