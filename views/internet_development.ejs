                <p>The internet's development began with ARPANET, an experimental network that demonstrated the feasibility of long-distance communication between computers. The development of key protocols like TCP/IP and early applications like Gopher and Telnet laid the foundation for today’s global network. This period marked the beginning of the internet’s transformation from a research tool to a global communication platform.</p>

                <h2>ARPANET: The Pioneer of Networked Communication</h2>
                <p>ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was launched in 1969 by the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA. It was the first operational packet-switching network, a revolutionary technology that enabled data to be broken into small packets and transmitted across a network, with each packet potentially taking a different route to reach its destination. This made communication more reliable and efficient.</p>
                <p>The initial ARPANET connected four universities: UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. It allowed researchers to share data, computational power, and resources. As ARPANET grew, it became a model for the modern internet, proving that geographically dispersed networks could communicate seamlessly. ARPANET’s development paved the way for modern network protocols and laid the groundwork for global internet infrastructure.</p>

                <h2>Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn: The Creators of TCP/IP</h2>
                <p>Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are credited with developing TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), the communication protocols that allow different networks to connect and share data. In the early 1970s, as ARPANET expanded, there was a need for a universal set of rules to ensure different networks could communicate with one another.</p>
                <p>In 1974, Cerf and Kahn introduced TCP/IP, which became the standard protocol for data transmission on the internet. TCP ensures that data is reliably transmitted by breaking it into packets and reassembling it at the destination, while IP addresses and routes the packets. The flexibility of TCP/IP allowed the internet to scale beyond ARPANET, accommodating networks of various sizes and types worldwide. Their work remains the backbone of the modern internet.</p>
                <p>The adoption of TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, often referred to as "Flag Day," marked a turning point in the development of the internet, as all ARPANET hosts were required to switch to the new protocol. This milestone made it possible for the internet to expand rapidly, connecting networks across the globe.</p>

                <h2>Early Programs on ARPANET: Gopher, Telnet, and More</h2>
                <p>Before the World Wide Web, ARPANET hosted several key applications that allowed users to communicate and share resources across the network. Two of the most notable early programs were Gopher and Telnet.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gopher:</strong> Developed in 1991 at the University of Minnesota, Gopher was one of the first systems designed to organize and share information over the internet. Gopher allowed users to browse and retrieve documents arranged in a hierarchical structure. Though eventually overtaken by the World Wide Web, Gopher was a critical step in developing user-friendly internet services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Telnet:</strong> Telnet allowed users to remotely access other computers on ARPANET. With Telnet, a user on one machine could log in to another machine as if they were physically present, enabling remote work and collaboration. This application was particularly useful for researchers who needed to access powerful computers from distant locations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These programs, while primitive by today’s standards, laid the foundation for more sophisticated applications that followed. They demonstrated the potential of networked communication and provided valuable lessons for the development of later internet technologies.</p>

                <h2>Milestones in Internet Development</h2>
                <p>The development of the internet was marked by several key milestones that accelerated its growth:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1971:</strong> Ray Tomlinson invented email, one of the earliest and most important applications of ARPANET, which allowed users to send messages to each other across the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>1973:</strong> ARPANET went international, connecting to networks in Norway and the UK, demonstrating the global potential of networked communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>1983:</strong> The adoption of TCP/IP, known as "Flag Day," made TCP/IP the standard networking protocol and opened the door for ARPANET to transition to the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>1990:</strong> ARPANET was officially decommissioned, marking the end of the pioneering network as it evolved into the broader internet.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These milestones highlight how the internet evolved from a military experiment into a global communication platform that connects people and systems worldwide.</p>
